    <h2>System Working Process</h2>
    <p>
        Our AI-based system detects spoofed or fake voice calls using advanced 
        machine learning and deep learning techniques. The process involves 
        multiple stages from audio input to final classification.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h3>1. Audio Input Collection</h3>
    <p>
        The user uploads a voice recording through the web interface. 
        The system accepts audio files such as WAV or MP3 format.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>2. Audio Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>
        The uploaded audio is cleaned by removing background noise 
        and normalizing the sound levels to ensure consistency.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>3. Feature Extraction</h3>
    <p>
        The system extracts important audio features such as 
        MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and spectrograms.
        These features convert the voice signal into numerical data 
        that the AI model can understand.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>4. Deep Learning Model</h3>
    <p>
        A trained deep learning model (CNN/LSTM) analyzes the extracted 
        features and identifies patterns that differentiate genuine 
        voices from spoofed or AI-generated voices.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>5. Classification</h3>
    <p>
        The model classifies the voice sample as:
        <ul>
            <li>Genuine Voice</li>
            <li>Spoofed Voice</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>6. Result Display</h3>
    <p>
        The final result is displayed instantly on the webpage, 
        allowing users to quickly identify suspicious or fraudulent calls.
